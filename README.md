# Hello, welcome to my Machine Learning practice portfolio

The goal of this repository is for me to practice machine learning either by implementing algorithms from scratch, or by using libraries (like Tensorflow) to implement more complex architectures.

You can also find here my solutions to the Textbook "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron.
