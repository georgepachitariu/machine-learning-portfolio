# Hi there, in this repo you can find ML projects I worked with:

1. I implemented AlexNet using TensorFlow and I benchmarked my implementation against the results in the AlexNet paper on cifar10 dataset and a subset of ImageNet (10 dog breeds).

2. I implemented the Region Proposal Network from Faster R-CNN (Object detection) using Tensorflow. The project includes preprocessing of the images to create the object detection features. In the model I used pre trained convolutional layers and transfer learning. I benchmarked my results against the results from the Faster R-CNN paper.

3. Practice with Kaggle datasets.

4. Other: Scratchpads made by following online tutorials.
