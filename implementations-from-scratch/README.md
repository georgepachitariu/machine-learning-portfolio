# Hello, welcome to my Machine Learning practice project

The goal of this repository is for me to practice  machine learning
by implementing from scratch most of the algorithms described in the
 Lecun paper: 
 
 [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
 [http://vision.stanford.edu/cs598_spring07/papers/Lecun98.pdf](http://vision.stanford.edu/cs598_spring07/papers/Lecun98.pdf)
 
 There is 1 input dataset, MNIST, and on the website it is written the 
performance of each ML algorithm on this dataset, so I used those 
benchmarks to check if I implemented the algorithms correctly.
